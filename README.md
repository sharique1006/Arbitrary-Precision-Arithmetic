# Arbitrary-Precision-Arithmetic
Arbitrary-Precision arithmetic, also known as "bignum" or simply "long arithmetic" is a set of data structures and algorithms which allows to process much greater numbers than can be fit in standard data types. In this assignment you will write an efficient  program to implement "bignum".
